Hello world!
It's Peter Tatsuda!
So far this course is exciting to me, although I am apprehensive about
the web pieces (getting CSS, Javascript, and HTML working together). 
The assignment on Git is going fine, I think this a good tool to learn. 
I have poked around on a couple of Android projects but never really taken 
the time to learn how to use this particular versioning program. 
By the way, DOS =/= bash, as bash is much more powerful and universal!
